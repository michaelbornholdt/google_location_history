## JavaScript-Heatmap

This script is based of that of [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/JavaScript-HeatMap-Creator/).

A tutorial on how to use this project available on [Codeburst.io](https://codeburst.io/how-i-created-a-heatmap-of-my-location-history-with-javascript-google-maps-972a2d1be240)
